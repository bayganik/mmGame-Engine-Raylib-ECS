Simple Game Engine using Raylib as the core, Entitas lite as the ECS engine.  The combination works !!

The engine and a sample Menu + few other scenes with sprites, animated sprites, compound sprites + simple card game,

https://github.com/rocwood/Entitas-Lite        (I've included Entitas here, since I made some minor additions)

Entity Component System (ECS) is used to allow for separation of concern when coding.
